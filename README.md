# T-Rex

T-Rex is an Evolutionary Neural Network. It learns by adjusting the strength of the connection weights by mutation and selection.

Main features:

- Binary feedforward neural network
- Configurable number of inputs, hidden layers and outputs
- Developed using object-oriented programming

## Network topology

### Input layer

The input layer has a configurable number of inputs. The input values can be 0 or 1

### Hidden layers

The number of hidden layers is configurable. The number of neurons of each hidden layer is the number of inputs of the neural network

### Output layer

The output layer has a configurable number of outputs. The output values can be 0 or 1

## Quick guide
